#Epicodus Lesson Tracker

This program is useful for Epicodus students and faculty alike. Faculty can create and edit lessons and track students progress over time. Students can mark which lessons they've completed and see what other students are working on the same lesson they are to facilitate finding a pair.

Install the program by cloning it, running bundle, creating a database, and running the migrations. You can also check it out on [Heroku] (http://epicodus-lesson-tracker.herokuapp.com).
